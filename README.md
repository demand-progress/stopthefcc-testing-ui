Currently our repos for swaps utilize Tipe.io. We had issue with one swap were logos went missing from our site due to caching issues with Tipe.io. This application takes a screenshot of the site once a day and when errors are seen an email is sent to your inbox with the image that is causing the error.

Get Started run:
